# A simple wrapper for running elixir nodes to ensure that nodes
# are started with credentials sufficient to cluster and attach to
# after they are running.
# 
# Usage:
# 
# elixir-start mix phoenix.server
# or
# elixir-start mix run â€”no-halt

# exit if any any command fails
set -e

# establish the name and cookie (if available)
name="${HOSTNAME//./-}@$(hostname -I)"

# todo: conditionally fetch the cookie if it's set

elixir \
  --name $name \
  -S $@
